# Learn-Python
Learn Python By Creating Knowledge Base For Others

## What the project does
This project aims at improving my knowledge and skills by means of creating a knowledge base that others can draw from for their own benefit.

## Why the project is useful
Apart from expanding my own knowledge and skills, it will help others starting with coding. Those who dont know how or where to start. Dont worry about it, we all were in that place in that position as one point in time. This project also starts from nothing and will evolve and grow, as I do, and as hopefully, you will do too.

## How users can get started with the project
Currently, this is just an empty repository that I have just created and populated with basic readme. However, stay tunned, as I intend to expand it and push updates as often as possible.

## Where users can get help with your project
Didn't really think about it yet. As it is early days, I will update this section in due course.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
Just Me, Myself and I
