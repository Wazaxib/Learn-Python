# <p align="center">WELCOME

First things first. Anybody can learn how to code. Anybody can learn how to
create things. We all just have our own timetables that others usually don't
take into account and that's where the frustrations are coming from.

I decided to expand my own knowledge and skills by giving back and hopefully,
teaching others how to code in an efficient and effective way. I will try
to explain all the things I wish I knew when I was starting and to actually
provide you with everything necessary to follow this project. 

Currently, there is no way for you guys to communicate with me directly and
efficiently, however I will try to implement something to aid it in the near
future. If you have any questions or need any help with the project, that
will be the platform to use.

As of today(29/03/2022), this project will have two parts, set-up and 
non-coding aids or tools and code part. I have been thinking a lot about
 forcing some form of order which should be followed, however apart from
following the coding part in order, I will leave the rest open to you. 
At the end of the day, it's your choice to, for instance, learn git and 
always have a backup. I recommend it, but its up to you.

That's it for now, this is only a first draft.
